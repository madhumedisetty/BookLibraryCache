# BookLibraryCache
## Scenario: 
A banking application where multiple users can deposit and withdraw money from their accounts. The system uses a cache to improve performance by storing frequently accessed bank accounts.

## Use Case:

### Caching: 
The system caches bank account details to reduce database access time. When a user requests their account details, the system first checks the cache.
### Concurrency: 
Multiple threads can perform deposit and withdrawal operations simultaneously, ensuring efficient handling of user requests.
### Efficiency Monitoring: 
The system tracks cache hits and misses to evaluate performance, helping to optimize caching strategies
